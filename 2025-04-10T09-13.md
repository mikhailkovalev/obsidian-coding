Covariance and contra-variance are terms that relate to the intersection between object orientation and generics.

Here's the question this concept is trying to answer:

1. We have a couple of "regular", "object-oriented" classes, `Base` and `Derived`.
2. We also have some generic type - let's say `List[T]`.
3. We know that `Derived` can be used anywhere `Base` can - does that mean that `List[Derived]` can be used wherever `List[Base]` can?
4. Could it be the other way around? Maybe it's the reverse direction and now `List[Base]` can be used wherever `List[Derived]` can?

If the answer to (3) is yes, it's called _**covariance**_ and we'll say declare `List` as having `covariance=True`. If the answer to (4) is true, it's called _**contra-variance**_. If none is true, it's _**invariant**_.

Bounds also come from the intersection of OO and generics. When we define a generic type `MyType<T>` - does it mean that `T` can be any type at all? Or, may I impose some limitations on what `T` might be? Bounds allow me to state that the upper bound of `T` is, for example, the class `Derived`. In that case, `Base` can't be used with `MyType` - but `Derived` and all its subclasses can.
