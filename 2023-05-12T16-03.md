```
o---o---o---o---o  master
         \
          o---o---o---o---o  next
                           \
                            o---o---o  topic
```
We want to make _topic_ forked from branch _master_; for example, because the functionality on which _topic_ depends was merged into the more stable _master_ branch. We want our tree to look like this:

```
o---o---o---o---o  master
        |            \
        |             o'--o'--o'  topic
         \
          o---o---o---o---o  next
```

We can get this using the following command:
```
git rebase --onto master next topic
```
